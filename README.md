## Final Implementations and Requirements Met

My original user stories are as follows:

1. As a guest planning a trip, I want to select my check-in and check-out dates on a booking form so that I can easily reserve a room online without needing to call.

2. As a potential guest, I want to send a message through the contact form so that I can ask questions or request special arrangements before booking, with an acknowledgement of submission so I know my message has been received.

3. As a potential guest who uses my phone to access the internet, I want to browse the site easily on a small screen, so that I can book or get information without difficulty while travelling.

Below, you can see how I have executed the needs stated in the user stories.

1. ![bookings page](assets/readme-images/bookings-page.png)
   ![bookings page 2](assets/readme-images/bookings-page-2.png)
   Here you can see that I have added a booking form to the website that includes the ability to select chekck-in and check-out dates.

2. ![contact page](assets/readme-images/contact-page.png)
   ![contact page 2](assets/readme-images/contact-page-2.png)
   ![contact submission confirmation](assets/readme-images/contact-submission.png)
   ![bookings submission confirmation](assets/readme-images/booking-submission.png)
   These screenshots show that I have added a contact form in order for potential guests to send a message to the hotel. I also added confirmation pages that show when a user clicks Submit on either form to show them that their form has been submitted.

3. ![home page mobile](assets/readme-images/mobile-home.png)

   ![bookings page mobile](assets/readme-images/mobile-bookings.png)
   ![bookings page mobile 2](assets/readme-images/mobile-bookings-2.png)
   ![restaurant page mobile](assets/readme-images/mobile-restaurant.png)
   Here are a few screenshots that show how my website has been optimised for mobile. I have used Grid throughout my site in order to apply different layouts to the forms and web pages across different devices, creating a responsive website.

## Testing

In order to test that all the links on my site work I will carry out a manual testing process. This will involve creating a spreadsheet to note the link text, the URL, the expected result, the actual result and whether or not it passes or fails.

See the outcome of the manual testing to ensure all links work.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Developed using Visual Studio Code

## Limitations

- This website was developed as part of a Web Application Development course.
- The contact and booking forms are for demonstration purposes only and do not send or store information.
- Future development could integrate backend functionality for handling form submissions.
